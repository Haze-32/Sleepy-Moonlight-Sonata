# Privacy Policy for Moonlight Sleep

**Effective Date:** March 30, 2025

**Introduction**

Moonlight Sleep ("we," "us," or "our") is a Roku channel that provides a relaxing video experience featuring Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata with nature sounds. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app. Since Moonlight Sleep does not collect personal information, this policy is straightforward.

**Information We Collect**

- **No Personal Information Collected:** Moonlight Sleep does not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, or payment details). The app does not require user accounts or logins.
- **Device and Usage Information:** The app may collect anonymous usage data through Roku’s platform, such as device type, app usage statistics, and crash reports. This data is collected by Roku, not by us, and is used to improve app performance. We do not access or control this data.
- **Third-Party Services:** The video content in Moonlight Sleep is hosted on the Internet Archive (archive.org). When you stream the video, your device communicates directly with the Internet Archive’s servers. We do not control how the Internet Archive handles your data, and their privacy practices are governed by their own policies (available at https://archive.org/about/terms.php). They may collect data like your IP address or device information as part of the streaming process.

**How We Use Information**

Since we do not collect personal information, we do not use or share any personal data. Anonymous usage data collected by Roku is used by Roku to provide analytics and improve the platform, as per Roku’s privacy policy (available at https://docs.roku.com/published/userprivacypolicy/en-us).

**Children’s Privacy**

Moonlight Sleep is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. The app is intended for general audiences.

**Security**

Since we do not collect personal information, there is no personal data stored by Moonlight Sleep that requires security measures. The video streaming is handled securely by the Internet Archive.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. The updated policy will be posted at this URL with a revised effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
